# Advanced flowgorithm projects
All coded in flowgorithm, with a python script to make the game playable

These need a separate python program to be run alongside them to actually have a non-stop game (until you loose) but you can just spam enter, that kinda works too

Please ignore the fact that sometimes if the tick rate for the Python program isn't right Flowgorithm just straight-up ignores the input

## Currently includes:
### Flappy bird

## TO RUN:
Make sure you `pip install keyboard`, then run `main.py`

Then run any of the flowgorithm files and get playing!

There will be a failsafe to make sure you do not break your computer, but **ALWAYS MAKE SURE YOU QUIT WITH THE Q KEY OTHERWISE YOU WILL FEEL PAIN**
