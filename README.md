# Advanced flowgorithm projects
All coded in flowgorithm, with a python script to make the game playable

**THESE ARE A WORK IN PROGRESS**

Also, every one of these can be run either in the new or old versions of Flowgorithm. I noticed the new version has features like file saving and turtle graphics which wouldn't have worked for these projects anyways, so I'm just leaving them out as a whole.

## TO RUN:
Make sure you `pip install keyboard`, then run `main.py`

Then run any of the flowgorithm files and get playing!

There will be a failsafe to make sure you do not break your computer, but **ALWAYS MAKE SURE YOU QUIT WITH THE Q KEY OTHERWISE YOU WILL FEEL PAIN**

## Currently includes:
### Flappy bird
`FlappyBird.frpg`
